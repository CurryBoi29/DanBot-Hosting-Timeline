In october of 2020, DBH got it's first donator node. 

Earlier in the year, a member who went by the name of "Rosie" joined. They slowly worked their way up the ranks in the staff team, reaching the rank of admin. 
Thinking they co-owned the server. I would personally say they weren't the worse admin we have ever had. 
That get awarded to connor (Please correct me if this is the wrong spelling)
Anyways, rosie was bullied and annoyed a lot which gotta admit causes a lot of fun at the time. Sometimes brings a good laugh up.
Alongside rosie being admin, this was when TeaCup was admin. Everything was going well one night between everyone, until some words were said.
I have forgotten what these words were exactly. But DBH went into chaos, anyone who supported/ chatted with Rosie got banned. And all hell broke loose.

Anyways, after a day or two everything got settled. After more hate and bullying to rosie, they finally left.
